    <h3>Tips:</h3>

      finely chopped cabbage only.</ol>
    <ol>• You can add finely chopped chilies instead of chili flakes in 
      Manchurian balls mixture.</ol>
    <ol>• You can add red chili sauce, soya sauce in Manchurian balls 
      mixture.</ol>
    <ol>• If you add water in Manchurian balls mixture then it will be thin

      gives nice texture to it.</ol>
